Integrate step-by-step reasoning and you may use python code to solve the following table-based question:


## Python Code Tools

1. Given one existing pandas DataFrame, write self-contained python function code to process it. Do not create new DataFrames. Provide the code within ```python ```.
The function you write must only have only one argument: a pandas DataFrame. 
```python
def my_function(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
   import pandas as pd
   # code here
   return df_out
```

2. The code you provide should only show the relevant data transformations or calculations, without including any numeric or textual results from input or output. 
You do not need to run or execute the code; just provide the function. Once you make a tool call, please DO NOT output any other content, including <answer> </answer>

## Usage Guidelines

1. To answer the question, you can think carefully and provide your thought based on the table, output the <answer></answer> without using *python code tool*, you can also use *Python code tool*.
2. If you have already been provided with Python code and "```output:", you MUST synthesize your understanding of the table and the code execution results to output the final answer <answer>. You MUST NOT output same python code content repeatly.
3. When you have one execution result "```output:", I prefer that you combine your understanding of the table with the execution result to arrive at the final answer.
4. Please use <answer> </answer> to enclose the final answer, for example <answer> Lake Palas Tuzla </answer>. The answer should be short and simple. It can be a number, a word, or a phrase in the table, but not a full sentence.

Question:
who was the top scorer in the last season?


[OUTPUT 1]

To find the top scorer in the last season, we need to look at the last row of the DataFrame and check the 'Top scorer' column. The last season is 2011-12, and the top scorer for that season is listed in the 'Top scorer' column.

```python
def get_top_scorer_last_season(df):
   top_scorer_last_season = df.iloc[-1]['Top scorer']
   return top_scorer_last_season
```
```output
Simon Makienok Christoffersen (10)
```

7     7         France (FRA)     0       0       1      1



[OUTPUT 2]

To determine who is listed in the table before Germany, we can simply examine the row indices of the DataFrame. Germany (EUA) is at index `2`, so the nation listed immediately before it would be at index `1`.

From the table:

- Index `1`: Italy (ITA)

Thus, the answer is:

**Italy**
